GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through our site.

You can create and publish GitHub Pages online using the Automatic Page Generator. If you prefer to work locally, you can use the GitHub for Mac and Windows apps, or the command line.

Pages are served over HTTP, not HTTPS, so you shouldn't use them for sensitive transactions, like sending passwords or credit card numbers.
